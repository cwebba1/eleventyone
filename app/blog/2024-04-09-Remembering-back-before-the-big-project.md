This morning I started my day by reading tutorials on my computer. I read an article that made me look through my recent prototype files for my Links and Buttons project. 

I had forgotten about the Links and Buttons project. I did lots of research. I want to write about links and buttons. 

In March I delved into a deep dive into my WordPress CSS code and typography. My work on my code base required intense research and consistent concentration. The typography refactor project took way longer than expected.

Long projects affect my connection to other projects. I've lost the thread of other work that I was doing. Now I need to pick up the threads of previous projects.

I've written many articles recently. I had a nagging feeling that I wrote an article that I lost, or that I wanted to write.

A description I found embedded into the Links and Buttons prototype is the kernel of my article.

Links and buttons may look the same but they are different. Buttons connect to JavaScript functions. Links go somewhere.

A key interest I have for links and buttons has to do with CSS attributes and selectors. I used data attributes in my prototype to make variations of the links and buttons.

I opened more tutorials to study. I also dug into Aria a little more. I am thinking of revisiting the project to add aria labels for the links. From what I have read a simple "ID" is enough of a label for aria and CSS selectors.

I discovered many other prototype projects in my 2024 Prototype folder. The other prototypes have to do with color, scrolling behavior, and animation. I plan to combine elements of these projects to redesign parts of my website.

These prototypes are the components that I use to build websites for clients.

I am working on creating a presentation to teach how to set up an Eleventy project. I was testing the course to decide how to include styles. I need to write a purpose statement to introduce the presentation. My goal is to keep the presentation to 40 minutes.

Another project is a HTML portfolio that I will print as a PDF. I intend to use it for self-promotion and project search. I have many work samples to add.

At the end of the March typography refactor project I published my article. There are two more articles to edit and publish. I want to get these done and out. I am eager to pick up work on my other projects. I am putting myself out to the world looking for paid projects where I can offer my design expertise.
