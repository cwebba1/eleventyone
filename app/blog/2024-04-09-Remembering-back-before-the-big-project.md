This morning I got on my computer and started my day by reading tutorials. Something I read triggered me to look for my recent Links and Buttons prototype project.

I had completely forgotten about this project. I did a lot of research and I want to write about links and buttons. I found a description embedded into the final prototype that is a kernel of the article that I want to write.

Recently I've written many articles. I had a nagging feeling that I wrote an article that I lost, or that I wanted to write.

While looking at my Links and Buttons prototype I opened more tutorials to see. I landed on a LinkedIn page comparing aria attributes and data attributes. [The LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-do-you-choose-between-data-attributes-aria-accessibility) invites me to "add to the discussion". I have something to contribute here.

The LinkedIn conversation is a little off message from what I have to say. I dug into Aria a little more. My key concern has to do with CSS attributes and selectors.

My prototype is "Links and Buttons". The difference is that buttons connect to JavaScript functions and links go somewhere. I used data attributes in my prototype to make variations of the buttons. I am thinking of revisiting the project to add aria labels for the links. From what I have read a simple "ID" is enough of a label for aria and CSS selectors.

In March I dropped into a deep dive into my WordPress CSS code base. It took way longer that I expected. Long projects affect my connection to other projects.

I am proud of the work I did on my code base. It required intense research and consistent concentration. But I've lost the thread of what I was doing. Now I need to pick up the threads of previous projects.

In my 2024 Prototype folder I discovered many other projects from February. The other prototypes have to do with color, scrolling behavior, and animation. These projects are working towards redesigning my website landing page.

I also have a HTML portfolio that I printed as a PDF. I intend to use it for self-promotion and job search. I have more samples to add.

In January I worked on creating a presentation to teach about how to set up an Eleventy project. I was testing the course to decide how to include styles. I need to write a purpose statement to introduce the presentation.

At the end of the March refactor project I published my article. There are two more articles to edit and publish. I want to get these done and out and to pick up the other projects. Now I need to put myself out into the world.
