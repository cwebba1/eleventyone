# Holed up and working from home

It is Monday morning and today I am in the office. It is raining outside. It has rained every day since Friday evening. So I have holed up inside.

Saturday I noodled the afternoon away. I looked at photography to decorate my screen share. I worked Saturday night, studying a tutorial. I made a prototype pattern for scrolling animation.

Yesterday I posted my website to Github multiple times. I posted the website and then found that the changes I had made over the past week got eviscerated. I had to dig in and find out why.

I ended up digging into my templating system about three layers deep to find the culprit. Once I did everything came together and I reposted to Github again.

Then I started to edit SASS and my website broke. I had some SASS Mixins to post gradients throughout the website. It wasn't working and when I turned it on, that's when the website broke. I had to download the SCSS folder from my Github repo to back-track and fix it.

My website is too complicated by half. Sometimes I am so amazed at how the website is woven together. How did I ever think this up? My website is spread out with many pages that each do different things. I organized the website with SASS files and template pages and partials.

I turned the SASS Mixin off and converted the gradients to custom properties. As I dug in I found that I had already started that process years ago. I hadn't finished. The leftover code was showing a problem in the terminal. 

Once I got the SASS working I edited copy on the [Content and Design](https://www.craigwebbart.com/content-and-design.html "Content and Design") page. I had planned to remove one word but I decided to keep it. It is a complicated sentence but I decided it was correct and what I wanted to say. I edited a different section and put a list of marketing content vehicles into a list structure. I moved sections of the page around and created an extra block quote as a callout.

Saturday night I was up until 2 am. Sunday night I worked until 1 am.

This morning I am reading a Twitter thread on X about "What would it take to go back into the office?" People say the most outrageous things. I am way out of my league. But it makes me think â€“ If I worked in an office would I be working at midnight?

I do not think so. What I find is that once I am working on a section of the website it behoves me to keep working through lunch and dinner. I work through the web of details to connect the templates, CSS and JavaScripts that I use. It is a benefit to work from home.

Addendum:
It has rained all day Tuesday too. I posted to Github again and wrote an amazing bit of code.
