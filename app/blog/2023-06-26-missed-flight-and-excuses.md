This is not the first time I have been delayed on flights with American Airlines. It happens for every flight.

Today's excuses were that the pilot who was to fly the plane boarding out of La Guardia Airport was a no-show. The flight would be delayed for half an hour while a substitute pilot would arrive. The second pilot would arrive fifteen minutes after the original flight time.

Once we boarded the plane the excuse was that the pilot could not get the computers to work. They needed to restart the computer. The plane took off one and three quarter hours behind schedule. I am going to miss the connecting flight to my three-leg journey.

I've been stuck in Dallas before. Every time I fly with American Airlines there is a problem.

The pilot and crew politely fluffed over the situation with explanations and excuses.

It makes me think about excuses, what are they and what are mine?

Excuses explain away a fault or compromise and mollify fault. They clear the situation in an unauthentic way. Excuses beg pardon or simply snag it. 

I have loads of excuses of my own. A look at my personal circumstance is enough fodder to see loads.

Where I live, my relationships, my career, all point to compromises. Excuses is a negotiation towards a compromise. I chose to live with a host of small problems because it is easier than doing the tough work to make change.

Making compromises is like a reverse accumulation of wealth. Instead on accruing compounding interest, compromises lead further and further astray. After awhile I no longer recognize myself, except that I've become used to the compromises. I have made excuses.
