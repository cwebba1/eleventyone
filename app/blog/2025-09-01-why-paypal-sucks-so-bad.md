<blockquote>Why does PayPal suck so bad? I tried to set up a Venmo for donations and I failed. PayPal's UI is awful.</blockquote>

**ChatGPT Speaks:**

You're definitely not alone in finding PayPal frustrating—many users vent similar frustrations online. Here's a breakdown of the most common pain points, especially relating to UI (user interface) and the headaches with setting up Venmo for donations:

**Why PayPal Can Feel Clunky**

**1\. Terrible Navigation & Overly Nested Menus**

Users frequently report that the PayPal UI buries features deep within nested menus, making it hard to find what you need:

“I agree with you that this interface is terrible. It has a form of design that is obviously intended to hide your information… finding a sub category … you will have to dig back and forth until you find the button.” <a href="https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/About-Settings/Paypal-New-Interface-Example-of-a-BAD-User-Interface-Design/m-p/1102739?utm_source=chatgpt.com">[PayPal Community</a>

**2\. Poor Readability & Excessive White Space**

The redesign with larger fonts and spacing makes scrolling a chore and reduces visibility:

“The new Transaction page uses big font … You can see a whole 8 transactions and then I have to hit the more button and scroll…” <a href="https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/My-Feedback-for-PayPal-Archive/New-interface-sucks-Old-one-wasn-t-great-either/td-p/871415?utm_source=chatgpt.com">PayPal Community</a>


**3\. Inconsistent Layouts & Confusing Checkout**

The checkout process is overly complex, full of fields and confusing flows, even for experienced users:

“So why is the checkout SO COMPLICATED??? ... I literally couldn't understand what's going on. So many instructions. So many fields to fill.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/13j5o6r?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reddit</a>

**4\. Clumsy Authentication & Timeouts**

Frequent logouts and multi-click login processes erode usability:

“PayPal times out... logging back in requires three clicks … click the log in prompt… log in button… ignore the promotional message… and click ‘go to my account.’ … design is annoying as all get‑out.” <a href="https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/Suggestions-for-PayPal/user-interface-usability-issue/td-p/2935334?utm_source=chatgpt.com">PayPal Community</a>


**5\. Dark UX Patterns & Hidden Defaults**

Some design choices seem intentionally deceptive—like defaulting to paid options even after selecting free ones:

“It had defaulted to the ‘transfer now’ choice, so it cost me $6. … What a horrible thing to do.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1gaff2n?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> Reddit </a>


**6\. Glitches When Adding Bank Accounts**

Many users struggle to link bank accounts due to awkward UI behavior:

“Try to add Fidelity as a bank account… No path forward… Workaround: type a bunch of garbage, and it will show you a button that will let you manually enter account details.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/18qw2hw?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reddit</a>


**7\. Slow Performance & Looping Login Screens**

Frequent re-authentication and laggy pages make the experience feel sluggish:

“Every step needs so much loading time. Every 1 minute I need to re‑login. The dashboard and the activity feed is so confusing.”

**Setup Nightmares with Venmo Charity Profiles**

If you’re trying to set up donations through Venmo via PayPal (especially for nonprofits), that introduces an extra layer of complexity.

**Common Issues From the Trenches:**

* Loops and endless redirects between platforms:  
  “It takes me to Venmo Charity Profiles... then says ‘already verified’ and takes me back to PayPal. I’m getting so frustrated\!”

* Renowned for being flaky and unresponsive support:  
  “I’ve been struggling for two months… get the same error message… Venmo's support folks are stumped… they open a tech ticket and nothing happens.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/venmo/comments/1hbeabj?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> Reddit </a>
* Account freezing or merging with personal profiles:  
  “It was a nightmare… The account was frozen upon creation… multiple chats… have led to nothing.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/venmo/comments/1gr6h9a?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> Reddit </a>
* Discomfort with linking a personal account to the charity:  
  “They require it to be linked to a personal Venmo account… I don’t want my personal account linked to the charity I volunteer for part‑time.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/1c72uew?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reddit</a>

**Official Requirements That Make It Tough:**

* You must verify charity status via PayPal.  
* The same person must own both the PayPal and Venmo accounts—ownership is non-transferable. <a href="https://help.venmo.com/cs/articles/venmo-charity-profile-setup-guide-vhel366?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Venmo Help Center</a> 
* Venmo will reject setups if info doesn’t match or there's a mismatch in phone number, ownership, or account status. <a href="https://help.venmo.com/cs/articles/charity-profile-sign-up-errors-vhel234?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Venmo Help Center+1</a> 
* Additional errors like “we can’t confirm your info,” “this link isn’t shareable,” or “timeout” are common blockers. <a href="https://help.venmo.com/cs/articles/charity-profile-sign-up-errors-vhel234?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Venmo Help Center</a>

**Summary Table**

| Issue Area | Why It Sucks |
| ----- | ----- |
| Navigation & Layout | Buried menus, oversized layout, poor readability |
| Checkout & Flow | Confusing steps, redundant forms — even returning users get tripped up |
| Authentication & Timeouts | Frequent logouts, multi-step login, slow loading |
| UX Design Choices | Hidden defaults magnified to extract fees or clicks |
| Technical Glitches | Bank linking weirdness, looping screens, unresponsive mobile buttons |
| Venmo Charity Integration | Ownership constraints, approval loops, flawed error handling, limited support |

**What You Can Do Next**

* **For UI frustration**: Consider providing feedback directly via the PayPal Community, or exploring third-party integrations (like DonorBox or Stripe) for smoother UX.  
* **For Venmo setup**:  
  * Make sure the charity owner matches across accounts.  
  * Use unique phone numbers and avoid account overlap.  
  * Address any “good standing” issues with IRS or regulatory bodies first.  
  * Be prepared to navigate redirects and reach out persistently to support.
