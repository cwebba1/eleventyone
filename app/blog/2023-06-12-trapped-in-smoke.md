## Trapped in smoke

Outside the sky is grey and tinged with yellow. Smoke and microscopic dust is in the air, coming for forest fires in Canada. This will be the third week of fire smoke blowing through. 

The second week was really bad. The fire smoke made international news as it turned the skies orange. I stepped outside for a few moments and quickly came inside. Even for a brief two moments it hurt.

On Saturday I woke with swollen lymph nodes. I took an extra aspirin. We have all of the windows closed but there is some leakage. After two weeks the dust surely must be getting in.

My neighbors that live above us have their windows open and they run their air conditioner.

Because I don't smoke I am very sensitive to the smoke and dust. Event hough I am indoors, I am constantly blowing my nose and sneezing.

On Friday we had a brief respite. The smoke blew in another direction and the air cleared for a bit. I got out and into my garden. I have plants to plant. I also went out Saturday and Sunday and worked on the garden. I have seeds sprouting in cups that I transplant into the garden. The seeds need to be separated into individual cups if two or more are growing together. Once they get big enough I can transfer them into the garden.

This is the best part of late spring and the weather has been great. It is such a waste to not be able to be outside. I need to get groceries.

This weekend I spent the days indoors. I am studying tutorials for web development and improving my Eleventy jamstack blog.

I have a page from the New York Times which shows how the wind is blowing and how bad the smoke is in the area. I keep updating and looking at it.

I also look at the NOAA photographs of the Eastern United States. The smoke is visible from space. It is the color of coffee with too much milk.

Today we may get rain and I hope that some of the dirt is washed out of the sky. I heard on the radio that the forest fire smoke will continue to pass through the area all this week. I am planning indoor activities. Wishing to be outside.
