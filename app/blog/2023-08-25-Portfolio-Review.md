## Portfolio Review

It has been a while since I have worked on my own website.

Recently I have invested time into building my Eleventy Jamstack project. I also built a website project for a client.

It is important to review websites and keep them up to date. My website is broad with a lot of sections and it needs review from time to time. I have a portfolio of work that I have done for clients. It is important for me to show and people to see what I can do. 

Many past clients have gone out of business or have died. For those whose websites are gone I am posting client websites on my server.

Reviving and posting old websites is somewhat a process of archeology. It is surprising to rediscover the work I did. Some of it is pretty amazing. I find little things that I did or built that will be useful for building future websites.

I tend to forget the things that I made, especially the JavaScript functions. Each website has some kind of embellishment. Usually I add a new code format as web development has progressed.

Simple HTML and CSS can do a lot. I embrace new, complicated technologies but for most projects they are not needed. Clients need clean design and good copy that embraces and supports their brand.

I am updating my website to showcase the work I do, preparing for new clients. A good client for me is someone who is starting a new business and needs a website to market themselves. I help to create new content. I help to create the client's brand.

It feels good to look back on my record of success. I am looking forward to the next journey.
