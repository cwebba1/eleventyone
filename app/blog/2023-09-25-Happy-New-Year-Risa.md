# Happy New Year Risa

Yesterday afternoon I called my friend Risa to say "Hello". She had called a week ago and I wasn't able to talk for long. She sounded sad at the time.

When I called yesterday Risa was glad to talk to me. She told me it was Yom Kippur but that she did not have the energy to go anywhere. Risa will turn 90 years old in December, two months away. Risa had covid and her energy is lower. 

So we chatted and had a fun call for about 50 minutes. I was glad that I called.

Risa has always been the sort of person who does six or a dozen things every day. Risa amazes me how she squeezes all she can out of every moment. This past year Risa is losing energy. Her walk is not so sure. 

I met Risa in the late '90's when we both made ceramic art at the Teacher's College at Columbia University. We became friends and we have stayed in touch over the years.

When Risa turned 80 she celebrated her birthday at a bar in the West Village. Her friends had a band and she danced. I asked her if she would dance this year on her birthday. She said no. The band musician she knew back then has passed. She does not know any musicians anymore.

Risa told me that Yom Kippur is the start of the new year. People have a clean slate and a fresh start to begin again. This year I am going to make a pact to talk to Risa often. She has always been a great and caring friend.

Happy New Year Risa. Happy birthday too.
