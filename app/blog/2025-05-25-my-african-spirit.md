I brought my African Spirit sculpture outside to give it a coat of teak oil.

I found this spirit in someone's trash about 20 years ago and brought it home. I found that it had an infestation of termites at the base and on one ear. I sprayed it with bug-spray and the problem never returned.

My African Spirit stood by my front door at my old house. It lives in my office / art studio now.

Periodically I give it a coat of oil, usually lemon oil. The teak oil has made it darker than before. I brought it to the garden to take its portrait.

I like my African Spirit.
