Recently I gathered small paintings that I mostly painted this year and brought them outside to give a first coat of spray varnish.

These are egg tempera paintings, mostly on canvas but some are on paper. It is a good idea to apply a coat of varnish to egg tempera paintings after they have had time to fully dry and polymerize.

After applying the spray varnish I brought them back inside and set them on my office desk and art table for a few days. It gave me a chance to see them together and appreciate them together.

What I like most about egg tempera painting is the vibrancy of color that can be achieved. My work is still developing. It feels good to see all the paintings together to see and assess my development.
