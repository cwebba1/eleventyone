description: My brother needs a new liver. He's does all he can to destroy himself.

This has become a hard day.

I got a call from a social worker who called to tell me that a review committee would meet to consider whether to give my brother a liver transplant. She was calling to find out what kind of support network is available to help him. She said Wade talked about his "Fiancée" Shannon.

Wade's "Fiancée" Shannon is an Internet catfisher. The social worker told me that they may fly Wade to Arizona to get a transplant. Arizona has a shorter transplant list. She said Wade will need 24/7 support for a month after the surgery.

I am wondering how I can make that happen.

I called Wade's ex-wife Diane. I got a rumor yesterday that Wade had told her to fuck off when she went to a second visit. It turns out he did. She was offering to take care of Wade when he got out. Diane bitched at me for 45 minutes about how he mistreated her and how much she had done for Wade over 30 years.

As hour or so later I got a text message saying that she washes her hands of Wade. It is her final decision.

Today afterwards I attempted to log onto my mother's Vanguard account to secure funding to help Wade. I have lost control of the account. Vanguard professes to have no record of me as being on the account. I revealed to mom has passed away. Now Vanguard is saying that Larry will be the primary beneficiary. They asked me to send a death certificate.

I logged on to update my password that I lost. When I log on I go to Larry's account.

I abandoned cart. I did not send a death certificate. Maybe once Larry dies I will be able to get the account. I don't want Larry's sister Gail to get her grimy hands on it.

Bitch.

So now I'm wondering how I will save my brother's life.

The answer that comes to me is to live my own. I am looking for remote work. The only way I would be able to care for my brother is if I have a job where I can be wherever I need to be.

So that is where I need to put my energy. Put the mask on myself first.
