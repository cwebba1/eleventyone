# Filling my creative well

This morning it is raining. I am on Twitter collecting photos of art.

Sometimes I do a deep dive on collecting and looking at other people's art. I need to fill my creative well. With the SAG strike grinding on there is not much new to watch and feed my head.

I've fallen into watching news and documentaries on YouTube. I find short ten minute clips. I've also watched some pretty long boring stuff.

Most of the time I watch late at night once I'm too tired to focus on coding. I watch to wind down. Oftentimes I fall asleep at my computer.

I like science and history. I enjoy watching and then forget about it. Few people like to talk about history and science. I like it. I also watch the news. I don't get to listen to much music.

I've noticed that YouTube is not very good at introducing me to new music or programming. If I listen to one album YouTube will keep presenting that same album.

YouTube often presents news clips from outlets that seem to be propaganda. I keep not selecting those shows but YouTube keeps presenting them to me. There isn't a way to direct YouTube to not show a certain broadcaster. The only available tool is to do a thumbs-down on an episode. I hesitate to do that. It is an inchoate signal. It is a poor user experience.

Anyway I hope that the SAG strike ends soon. I don't see a lot of movies but I feel the absence. I suppose I should read books.
