Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup  
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe  
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind  
Possessing and caressing me  

Jai guru deva om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes  
They call me on and on across the universe  
Thoughts meander like a restless wind  
Inside a letter box they  
Tumble blindly as they make their way  
Across the universe  

Jai guru deva om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  

Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing  
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me  
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns  
And calls me on and on across the universe  

Jai guru deva om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  

Jai guru deva  
Jai guru deva  
Jai guru deva  
Jai guru deva  
Jai guru deva  
Jai guru deva...
