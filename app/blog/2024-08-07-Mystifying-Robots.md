I am rereading articles about Liminal Design. I am interested to explore and try some liminal design ideas visually in a web page format. Just for fun.

Some elements of code design I might use include grid layout, animation, clipping paths, SVF filters and color modulation. I am guessing.

I wish to make a poetic layout. A meaningful unexpected experience that transcends the ubiquitous nature of modern web design technology. The technology  of modern design is transactional: websites designed for efficiency, scale, and predictability.

Worse, the user experience of business efficiency has already become homogenized, tested, automated. The directions have been web-scraped and fed into the AI computer databases and the Bootstrap libraries. We already know what it looks like.

So I am going to make something that does not go directly from A to B. Something not about get the widget, pay and checkout.

I don't know what it will look like. I imagine that the design and creation of this object will be as indirect and meandering as the finished artifact. I only know now that I am on my way.
