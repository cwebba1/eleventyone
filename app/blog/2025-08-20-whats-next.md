I've completed a two-month stint working on lithography at The Art Students League and now I'm thinking about what is my next journey.

Working on lithographs at The Art Students League felt great. I wondered why I waited so long to get into an art space and to make prints. 

When I complete a painting it tells me what the next painting will be. So this is a time to allow myself to imagine the next step of the journey.

Now when I've enjoyed this great experience I am taking a moment to absorb how it feels so I can replicate it and keep going. I know what I like. Being in an art community like The Art Students League is where I feel like I am being myself.  

I want to find my way as a working artist. The pieces are in place. I need to put them together. 

<h2>Let's count recent wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Since Covid, I have returned to making art</li>   
<li>I am painting with egg tempera and drawing</li>   
<li>I was invited to be in a group show in New Mexico</li>   
<li>I taught two egg tempera workshops in spring 2025\</li>   
<li>I worked in lithography and etching at the art students league</li>   
<li>I gave a presentation about variable fonts to tech developers</li>   
<li>I am building an application tool and experimenting with AI tools</li>
</ul>
So now the next thing. I am looking for opportunities and open to possibilities. There are a lot of art resources in New York City, often hidden in plain sight. But art is everywhere. What I want is a stable home for the next 5 \- 8 years with room to work.

I want to take this moment to do a war dance and celebrate my wins, and meditate on how to best manifest myself as I take the next step.
