This screed is not about making art. It is an expression of concern with the incredibly long time it takes to make a backup of my mac using the Apple Time Machine app.

Apple recently posted a system update and I installed it. I've done a certain amount of work since last week. After the first hour Apple Time Machine began to report that the backup will take another seven hours. That is eight hours altogether, representing a full day of work.

I am on a 2015 15-inch MacBook Pro with a macOS Monterey operating system. I just upgraded to Monterey version 12.6.8. I make backups on a solid state MiniPro SSD.

The time required to make Apple Time Machine backups has gotten increasingly longer since upgrading to Monterey. Eight hours to make a backup is intolerable.

I have to say that I loath to update the operating system on either my computer or my iPhone. Apple's user experience, style and applications only seem to get worse, never better. I am here to say that the Apple Computer experience is no longer great. It has not been great for a long long time.

I prefer to not open apps, move or alter document while my computer update process is working. Waiting eight hours for a backup is ridiculous. 

Please contact Apple with the bugs and problems you discover. Apple needs to start listening to users.

> Update: Time Machine froze and after restarting the computer I was able to backup my system. I made a second backup to be more certain that I successfully backed up my computer.
> I still think it is unpredictable buggy software.
