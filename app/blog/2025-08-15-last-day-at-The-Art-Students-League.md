Today is the last day of the summer session at The Art Students League. I am finishing up my work in the lithography studio.

Midway through the July monthly session I was hired as a monitor for the two printing studios, etching and lithography. The Art Students League has a system of classroom monitors to open and close studios, and to watch over the artists who are working there. The monitor job is a minor position of responsibility and trust. I received credit towards tuition as compensation, which allowed me to work in August.

I found the artists and culture at The Art Students League to be engaged and friendly. The Art Students League has been a gateway and window into the New York City artist community.

I recommend The Art Students League to anyone who wants to connect and make art in New York City. Their system is that artists sign up for monthly sessions. Rather than paying semester-long fees, participation costs are thus minimized. Artists can ask to have sessions count toward a certificate program if they so choose.

In July I created a lithograph entitled &ldquo;The Battle of Hong Kong – Tear gas fight&rdquo;. I made a small edition of 20 prints. In August I embarked on a two-color print which is untitled. That project ended with a series of artist proofs. I did not make an edition of the print.

Yesterday and today I knocked out a final print, a touche-wash print entitled &ldquo;Friends&rdquo;. I made a small edition of eleven prints.

I look forward to working again at The Art Students League as well as other art opportunities.
