<p>Recently while working on new research and development tutorials, I crossed paths with projects that I worked on earlier this year and forgot.</p>
<p>I am building a library of ready-to-go components using a variety of new CSS and JavaScript programing techniques. I need to remind myself of what I've done. This post is a list and description of prototypes and projects from the first half of 2023.</p>

<h2>Sass Build Systems, Node, Gulp, and Eleventy</h2>
<p>I started to update my front end design systems in October 2022. By January I built five or six. These systems help to automate work with Sass, image optimization and JavaScript. Of these, one system is built with Gulp, another works directly in Node. In addition, my Eleventy JamStack also processes Sass.</p>
<h2>WordPress Custom Block Theme from scratch</h2>
<p>In the Spring, I built a custom WordPress Block Theme for a client website. The WordPress Block Theme syntax is an evolving standard.</p>
<h2>Parallax</h2>
<p>Parallax is a design technique that uses CSS Translate and Zoom declarations to provide an illusion of depth and of design elements scrolling at different speeds. I worked from a tutorial provided by Keith Clark.</p>
<h2>CSS Intersection Observer with Scrolling Animation and Transitions</h2>
<p>CSS Intersection Observer is a CSS API that allows designers to target design elements when they come into view upon scroll. Various transformations and animations are triggered as the user scrolls.</p>
<h2>CSS View Transitions (Page Transitions without JavaScript)</h2>
<p>The View Transitions API is so brand-spanking-new that it only works on Chrome. Soon it will work on all major browsers. View Transitions blends and smoothly transitions between two pages like a complex JavaScript program, but with a few lines of CSS.</p>
<p>Individual page elements can also be targeted for transitions. I've also seen examples of View Transitions being combined with JavaScript. I will test a variety of patterns and techniques.</p>
<h2>Trigonometric functions in CSS</h2>
<p>Trigonometry is a new set of CSS value functions with many uses. Trigonometric functions provide a capacity to position design elements mathematically, breaking out of the box model.</p>
<h2>CSS Value Functions</h2>
<p>Trigonometric functions is one of many CSS Value Functions. There is a long list. Included are other Math functions, Translate, Rotation, Scaling, and Skew functions, Matrix functions, Filter functions, Color functions, Image functions, Counter functions, Shape functions, Reference functions, Grid functions,
Font functions, Easing functions, and Animation functions. Some of these I am using. Some I have yet to learn.</p>
<h2>CSS Color Filter Properties</h2>
<p>CSS Color Filter Properties are one set of CSS Value Functions. Any image or element can be altered by hue, blur, saturation, color and more. Filter properties can be stacked and chained together.</p>
<h2>CSS + JavaScript a11y Tabs - progressively enhanced</h2>
<p>Tabs is a common design technique used to condense information so that users can visually scan and access information without scrolling. Often tabs makes information hard to access for disabled users. The tutorial I studied made an effort to make data accessible for Reader devices.</p>
<h2>Chroma.js Color Library, New CSS Color Spaces</h2>
<p>Chroma.js is a color library built by the same Evil Martin folks who make PostCSS and Tailwind. I built a color tool to interpolate two colors and provide values. The interpolation is output using the OKlch color space, one of many new color space options. My goal is to create a color app to help choose coordinated colors.</p>
<h2>JavaScript Local Storage</h2>
<p>Learning JavaScript Local Storage is a step in the direction of creating my color app. I need to create a matrix by cross-interpolating one set of interpolations with a second set of interpolations. Local Storage is a method to store values and retrieve them.</p>
<h2>Eleventy JamStack web development</h2>
<p>I spent loads of time on building an Eleventy Jamstack system in 2022. This year I added functions to properly track and display dates and add automatic navigation data. I also built a custom card layout to display blog posts. You are reading my Eleventy blog right now.</p>
<h2>Eleventy Blog posting on Netlify.com</h2>
<p>I am still a baby about Netlify. My Eleventy blog is here. I am writing a lot.</p>
<h2>CSS Cards – Single-card pattern</h2>
<p>I have made many types of cards. This card component is a column format. This card has a headline, an image in a figure element, a text section, and a button. The card has a box-shadow. The card can be used anywhere – in grid, flexbox and vanilla HTML layouts.</p>
<h2>Desktop / Mobile Card (Pair-programing-challenge)</h2>
<p>This card component has a lot of fancy design elements. The layout changes between mobile and desktop. This card was built in a Pair Programing Meetup while helping a friend complete a design challenge and learn CSS.</p>
<h2>Pair Programing, Meetup and Discord</h2>
<p>Networking with other developers offers opportunities to develop connections and work on teamwork skills. Meetups where I participated include D3, React, UX/UI and WordPress. Meetups in New York City are often sponsored and hosted by big corporations. I get to see company work environs and learn about company cultures.</p>
<p>This year I am active with Hacker Hours, Code &amp; Coffee and a Writer's Meetup. I joined a Pair Programming Meetup where we meet on Discord. Pair Programmers  work together on projects in real time. Pair Programming Meetup Programmers share their projects using VS Code and work across the Internet using LiveShare.
In addition to this Pair Programming Meetup and Discord, I am also a member of Discords for Hacker Hours, Code &amp; Coffee, OpenProps, StackOverflow, PostCSS, Storybook, Eleventy, and many more.</p>
<h2>CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox</h2>
<h3>Grid-Sticky-Footer</h3>
<p>Sticky footers are one of those patterns that seem to require repeated revisits. I already have a sticky footer designed in Flexbox. Years ago sticky footers required hacks to push the footer to the bottom of the page. I made this grid sticky footer pattern to have in case I need it.</p>
<h3>Grid Stacking Declaration</h3>
<p>The idea behind this tutorial-based prototype is to have a two-column header with an image panel and a text panel on desktop. At mobile or tablet widths the text background color disapears and the text stacks on top of the image.</p>
<p>I add reference notes into my prototypes. This prototype notes say that the technique needs refinement. The header height is dependent on the image height. I put images inside a figure element. Variations are needed to see what works better.</p>
<h3>Nested-Grid Form</h3>
<p>This simple form layout changes from two-columns to single-column on mobile. It uses a media query. All form inputs are the same width. Using grid styles and fr widths is different from using a percentage-based form layout. A more detailed form with different sized form inputs requires widths to be specified.</p>
<h3>Grid Card-Layout</h3>
<p>This layout uses the column-card molecule I made. The cards are fluid width with a clamp. The layout changes from three columns to two, and one column for mobile width.</p>
<p>I tested both Grid and Flexbox for multi-card layouts.</p>
<h2>CSS Flexbox</h2>
<h3>Flex Card-layout</h3>
<p>This layout is the same as the Grid Card-layout except that it uses Flexbox. Odd cards expand to full width in this pattern.</p>
<p>I chose the Flexbox multi-card pattern to use for blog posts. In the blog version The odd extra card is modified with a width clamp so it does not expand.</p>
<h2>Bento-box Layout using CSS Flexbox + Grid</h2>
<p>Bento-box refers to a dish with various sized compartments to serve Japanese food.
This layout uses a combination of flexbox and grid. It is not yet resolved for fluid layouts.</p>
<h2>CSS Card Layout for Eleventy Blog</h2>
<p>The flexbox card layout is applied to my Eleventy blog. Currently the page is named &quot;Possibilities&quot;. I plan to replace the blog page with this layout. I like the card layout because it presents three blog entries side-by-side for faster viewer consumption. The pre-exisitng static layout lists each blog one below the other in a single column layout.</p>
<h2>Reverse engineer New York Times components</h2>
<p>I am in process of teasing apart the layout components in The New York Times. The New York Times might be characterized as a &quot;bento-box&quot; layout. It has large and small components of various sizes and patterns. Some of the small components appear to use a sub-grid layout.</p>
<h2>Floats</h2>
<p>I conducted research to see how floats work with Flexbox and Grid. It turns out that Floats do not work with either. There is also no simple Grid or Flexbox substitute that works as easily as &quot;float left&quot;.</p>
<p>I built a set of float patterns that use CSS clamp to create fluid image widths for desktop and full-width images for mobile.</p>
<h2>No-JQuery Lightbox</h2>
<p>I tested five Lightbox programs and chose one that uses JavaScript with no dependencies. I tested and modified styles. I intend to integrate it into my Eleventy blog.</p>
<h1>Soon To Come:</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Create a Triangle with CSS Clipping Path</h2>
<p>I am working on an app to choose coordinated colors. It requires a triangle-shaped layout. Making a triangle in CSS turns out to be complicated. CSS hacks exist to make an object that looks like a triangle but they are not really triangles.</p>
<p>Clipping Path is a CSS method to create polygon shapes. Ultimately I will need trigonometric functions to position elements within the triangle.</p>
<h2>Combining Prototype techniques</h2>
<p>I plan to incorporate and combine patterns for my Eleventy blog. I envision combining Image Floats with Lightbox. I will integrate Intersection Observer, Scrolling Animations, Transitions, and View-Transitions into my blog layout.</p>
