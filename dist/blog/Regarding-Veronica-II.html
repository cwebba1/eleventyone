<h1>Regarding Veronica</h1>
<h2>A film that will shift the cultural conversation.</h2>
<p><em>Fired from her teaching job at a Catholic school, a transgender woman contemplates suicide until she meets a seven year old girl with two fathers &ndash; one of whom recently left with a woman &ndash;and they have a profound impact on each other&rsquo;s lives.</em></p>
<div style="border: 3px solid #33aa33; padding:1em 1em 1.5em; background:#F6FFCE;">
$300,000 has already been successfully raised, and we are currently raising the remaining $226,000 to get us through production, as well as post-production and marketing.  
<p>The $526,000 <em>Regarding Veronica</em> budget is backed by a Risk Management Strategy, which includes leveraging the New Jersey Film Tax Credit Incentive, guaranteeing a 35% return on all above-the-line costs and 30% on all below-the-line costs, + 2% Diversity Bonus.</p>
<p>Investor Units are available for $50,000 each.  Half units are available upon request. Investors will receive principal and 20% preferred return plus 50% of net profits, pari passu/pro rata.</p>
<p>Another way of being a part of the film is by making a tax-deductible donation to our fiscal sponsor The Great Griffon, a 501(c)3 whose mission of telling tales of the underdog within the LGBTQIA community aligns with the themes of <em>Regarding Veronica</em>.</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Although a work of fiction, <em>Regarding Veronica</em> is inspired by true events. Several years ago, co-writer and director <b>Jennifer Bobbi</b> had a thriving business in Long Island. When she summoned the courage to come out publicly as trans, she lost 80% of her clients, had to sell her apartment, was forced into bankruptcy, and was even temporarily homeless. This story is not unique to Jennifer, as 90% of trans people have experienced discrimination at work.</p>
<p>The injustice of the Catholic church is another deeply personal element. Having attended Catholic school for 13 years as a closeted gay person in a conservative home, co-writer and director David Beck understands firsthand the pain that comes from believing in a God that doesn&rsquo;t allow you to be your true self, and the heartbreak and shame that ensues within religious families.</p>
<p>Ironically, after the first draft of <em>Regarding Veronica</em> was written, David&rsquo;s 11th grade English teacher was fired by the Archdiocese of Cincinnati for being gay after over 20 years of teaching there. Of course, this prejudice is not unique either, as many wonderful teachers have been fired from Catholic schools for being gay or trans, but the fact that this happened to David&rsquo;s own teacher has been a major impetus to get this film made.</p>
<h2>The Power of Film</h2>
<p>Stories told on the screen have potential for national, even global, impact. <em>Regarding Veronica</em> explores some serious and perhaps confusing topics, but told through the eyes of childhood with a delicate touch, humorous dialogue, and authentic relationships, this story will reach the hearts of millions of people.</p>
<h2>The Regarding Veronica Family</h2>
<p>Representation has been the cornerstone of building the cast and crew. <em>Regarding Veronica</em> consists of a diverse and talented cast of Broadway veterans and television stars including trans actress <b>Alexandra Grey</b> (recently appearing in Billy Porter&rsquo;s <em>The Life</em> at NY City Center), <b>Abigail Hawk</b> (<em>Blue Bloods</em>), and trans activist <b>Chandi Moore</b>.</p>
<p>There is trans representation at every level from the executive producer to the creative team to the production assistant. There is every letter of the LGBTQIA community on board. The vast majority of the crew is female identifying, and people of color make up over 50% of the crew.</p>
<p>All the creative producers&rsquo; love of storytelling was birthed in the theatre, so the communal spirit that theatre cultivates will transcend to the <em>Regarding Veronica</em> set.</p>
<p>What we have and what we need: $300,000 has already been raised out of a $575,000 budget, which means that we are more than half way there. We humbly accept tax-deductible donations through our fiscal sponsor, or private investment with returns (eligible for the NJ Film Tax Credit), or a combination of the two. <em>Regarding Veronica</em> will not be made this summer without your support. The filmmakers thank you for your belief in this beautiful ship we&rsquo;ve built and for granting us the wind to sail.</p>
